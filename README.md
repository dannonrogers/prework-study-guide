# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

To learn more about the curriculum for my upcoming Full Stack Coding Bootcamp through UCLA Extension, I began my prework study. I've created this Prework Study Guide from learning and applying basic HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. This will serve as an easily accessible study resource that I will continue to develop as I complete the program.
